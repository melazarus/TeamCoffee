# TeamCoffee
Coffee breaks for teams.

## About
Every hard working developer needs coffee. Drinking coffee on your own is ok but not very efficient or social.

The TeamCoffee project tries to make drinking coffee with your team easy and enjoyable. Minimizing the ammount of communication required.

### The wand.

Version one (The Analog Version) requires a laser cutter and a few minutes of your time.
It has however a large drawback, that is, it is not as noticable as it could be. This means it will take time before alle other team members realize you need coffee. (and may require you to verbaly communicate again)

Version two (The digital version) is a bit more complex and solves the communication issue by adding blinky lights.
The lights will active automatically when you wave the sign. Offcourse the sign can be charged by USB.

Verion three (The wireless version) adds a wireless component. (wifi or other) This way your team members will get a notification on their computer when someone waves their TeamCoffee wand.

### The coaster

The coaster is a smart, connected and social coffee coaster. We're not clear on specs but here are some ideas
- sense empty cups by comparing the weight with a empty cup reference
- app to update you'r twitter feed on certain events
- built in lights indicating the temperature, full/empty state or coffee level of colleagues.
- usb or wireless.
- other fun stuff..
